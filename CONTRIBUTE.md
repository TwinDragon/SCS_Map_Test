First things first, I do want to thank anyone who is considering on contributing here with map tile generation for both *American Truck Simulator* and *Euro Truck Simulator 2*!

Onto the main part of how to contribute here.

## Generating Map Tiles

JagFX already wrote out how you can generate map tiles in their [TsMap2](https://github.com/JAGFx/ts-map/tree/feat/rework#how-to-use-) *README* file. Follow those instructions to generate the tiles; the process will take a few minutes depending on your system.

*Note: You must own all DLC for the game of which you wish to generate tiles for.*

## Zip The Files

Check your *Output* folder for the map files, and zip/rar them for easy uploading. I would prefer you have a name scheme like **ats_v1.41.zip** or similar. If it's a mod map such as Promods, please use something like **ats_pro_v1.41.zip** so I know which is which.

## Contribute File(s)

Now that you have a zip, it's time to actually contribute them! It's pretty simple, just open a [New Issue](https://github.com/TwinDragon/SCS_Map_Tiles/issues/new/choose) and link the file using whatever service you prefer. That could be Google Drive, MEGA, OneDrive, etc... Whichever is easiest.

### Promods Note

I want to make a mention that I do not personally use the Promods Map Mod for either game. Thus, I can't really generate the tiles for this purpose and this is where I will need help with. How fast they update, I'm not sure. If anyone is willing to generate those, by all means let me know!
